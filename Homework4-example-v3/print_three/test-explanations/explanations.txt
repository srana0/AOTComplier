This package is intended to agree on the input and output format, as well as to provide explanations on the assignment.

1)
constantpool1.vmclass - a binary file describing the constant pool for just one method that follows right after main

Its contents are:
First, for main,
Address  Argument count     Argument types                Return type 
1024     1                  0000 0000                     2
         arg                (bitmask, left to right)      no return
Then, for the second function (index 1 in the constant pool)                            
Address  Argument count     Argument types                Return type 
1038     1                  0000 0000                     0
                            (bitmask, left to right)      an int

Note everything is in big-endian... Similar to JVM
Constant_pool_bytes.PNG shows the bytes.
Constant_pool.PNG shows the structure in a hierarchical view.

2)
PrintThree.bvmclass - a binary file that contains bytecode for the two functions: main, and another one, that does the heavy lifting.

Bytecode_bytes.PNG shows the file contents.

The other two files, named after the functions they represent (Main.png and make thre.PNG)
show exact interpretation of the bytecode.

execution instructions:

./a.out -e PrintThree.bvmclass -c PrintThree.constantpool 0

Expected output:
3

PrintThree.java is something that roughly represents the program (except we work on a reduced bytecode)
